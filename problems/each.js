/*

Calls a callback iterator(value, index/key, collection) for each element of collection.
Accepts both lists and objects.

Note: Some functions such as this one which take a list can work on either
an Array or a String

Note: 'each' does not have a return value, but rather simply runs the
callback function over each item in the input collection.
