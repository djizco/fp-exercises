/*

Returns true if its arguments are equivalent, false otherwise.
For arrays and objects, it should do a shallow equality
for each property or item in each collection.

Challenge: for the challenging version, you will need to do a deep
equality on objects and arrays.  This will require recursion. You
will also need to handle cyclical objects.
